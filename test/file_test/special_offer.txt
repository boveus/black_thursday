Dear Mr. Dog, 
 
 We here at the Umbrella Corp.
    , I mean Etsy, value our customers. However, while we understand that
    various circumstances may occur, we are unable to compromise in regards
    to our revenue stream. 
 It's for the customers, you see.  If we don't
    have money to build our mansions, I mean pay our workers, we cannot
    possibly continue.  So while it may seem trivial, we believe it to be of
    upmost importance that our policy is 'understood' by all those who
    share in our Etsy Family. 
  We have a few individuals who we would
    like to extend a special offer, along with a reminder of how much Etsy
    values their patronage. 
  We believe you to have a particular set of
    skills, that make you ideally suited to extend these offers, on our
    behalf.

    recognition, of your hard work.  Thank you, and please, don't contact

 The Etsy Family,
