## Black Thursday

Find the [project spec here](https://github.com/turingschool/curriculum/blob/master/source/projects/black_thursday.markdown).

This was a 2-week project to create a business intelligence relational database.  The database was based on several CSV files that had foreign key and primary key relationships with one-another.  This was a paired project that I worked on with @sidewinder2020.
